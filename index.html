		<h2><strong>A Sleep You Can't Deny</strong></h2>
		<p>Imagine a sickness where millions of people fell into a deep, deep, <em>deep</em> sleep from which they could never wake up from. From the lucky few that did, we know that they were reminded of being trapped in a cage, not being able to move or talk, <strong>but they are fully aware of what was going on around them</strong>. This sickness came and went all across the globe, affecting millions in just a few decades. Those who survived this terrible epidemic were then forgotten, its trace unheard of, so many questions were left unanswered.</p>
