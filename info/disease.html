    <section><h2>The History</h2>
        <p> Encephalitis Lethargica popped up during the great war, and at the time people who were dealing with patients that had fallen under strange sickness though they were the only ones experiencing this. It was not until after the war that information was shared more freely that it was discovered that this was happening everywhere. <br> Germany was one of the first few to notice this disease as doctors soon discovered that their soldiers were coming down with rather strange symptoms that were different from patient to patient, some had fevers, headaches, nausea, some even experiencing odd ticks, some looking to be in a catatonic state, and even <i>uncontrollable hiccuping.</i>.
            Patients had no common exposure nor no family links that would give reason for why so many would get this disease. The only thing they had in common was their <b>unbearable sleepiness</b>.</p>
