    <header><h1>Information On The Sickness</h1></header>
    <section><h2>The History</h2>
        <p> Encephalitis Lethargica popped up during the great war, and at the time people who were dealing with patients that had fallen under strange sickness though they were the only ones experiencing this. It was not until after the war that information was shared more freely that it was discovered that this was happening everywhere. <br> Germany was one of the first few to notice this disease as doctors soon discovered that their soldiers were coming down with rather strange symptoms that were different from patient to patient, some had fevers, headaches, nausea, some even experiencing odd ticks, some looking to be in a catatonic state, and even <i>uncontrollable hiccuping.</i>.
            Patients had no common exposure nor no family links that would give reason for why so many would get this disease. The only thing they had in common was their <b>unbearable sleepiness</b>.</p>
        <article><h3>When in a Horrid Sleep</h3>
        <p>While sleeping for days, weeks or even years on end sounds relaxing Encephalitis Lethargica was anything but that.

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

    <li>Your muscles would never lose their rigidity.</li>
  <li>Your pupils would dilate, your eye muscles wouldn't twitch.</li>

        <section><h2>A Little More on The Sleepy Sickness</h2>
        <dl>
  <dt>Encephalitis Lethargica</dt>
  <dd>Most doctors had no clue what had caused the disease, it was believed that Encephalitis Lethargica was an infectious pathogen. Because when injecting infectious tissue of an Encephalitis patient into a mnkey, it would exhibit similar symptoms.</dd>
  <dt>Encephalitis Lethargica death rate</dt>
  <dd>Between 40-50&#37; of people who came down with this sickness died. Mosty due to failure of the respiratory system, and autopsiers show that here was <em>something</em> oing on in the mid-section of the brain. The part that controls sleep. It was commonly swollen and damaged.</dd>
            <dt>The epidemic that occured during the 1900's was not entirely new.</dt>
            <dd>There have been epidemic of unexplained sleep problems dating as far as the 1600's. This was probably the inspiratio for <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>.</dd>
            <dt>Those that get out of the sleepy sickness are never the same.</dt>
            <dd>Many patients feel no remorce for hurting themselves, and are unbothered when they yank out their eyes, or cut their fingers off. Which is interesting as right before they fall under a deep sleep, people experience a complete change of character, often becoming violent and loud.</dd>

  <li>Could Encephalitis forshadow a severe epidemic?</li>
  <li>The way you experience this sickness (and to some, the way you get out of it) varies with your trauma, what you like, and your childhood.</li>
